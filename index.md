### Problem Statement

Health care accessibility and affordability has been at the forefront of issues that
Americans face on a daily basis. Health care costs often prevent people from seeking
proper treatment, and medical bills can be a major financial burden on U.S. families,
especially those that are in lower-income households, do not have insurance, or have a
serious medical condition. We hope to determine which factors play a bigger role in
determining the final cost of insurance to provide patients with ways they can reduce
their overall costs by making changes to factors they can control.
